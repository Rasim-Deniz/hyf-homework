Etli Ekmek


This pizza like dish originates in Konya/Turkey. Konya is known as City of Rumi. Mawlānā Jalāl ad-Dīn Rumi is the famous Medieval poet, philosopher, and scholar.
“Etli ekmek” means bread with meat in Turkish which is very common in cities in the central part of Turkey. It is very thin, crispy and yummy. It might resemble to Lahmajun, but in fact it differs from lamajun in following ways:
thin and crispy crust,
no use of parsley,
usage of lesser amount of onion,
chopping the ingredients to a finer degree (usage of food processor),

Ingredients
For crust

1 cup lukewarm water
1/3 cup cooking oil
1 tsp active dry yeast
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar

all-purpose flour (approx 2.5-3 cups)

For topping

10 oz ground beef
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, finely chopped
4 Italian pepper, finely diced
Salt
Black pepper
Paprika

Cumin powder
Red crushed pepper (depends on you)

Preparation

To make the dough, combine warm water, sugar and yeast in a mixing bowl, add salt and oil. Gradually add flour until it is nice and soft dough like pizza dough. Let it rest for at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, put ground beef, chopped onion, green peppers and tomatoes in food processor and process it until smooth.

Grab some dough big as a small egg and roll it out oval shape as thin as you can. It is supposed to be very thin. Spread ground beef topping evenly on top of dough you rolled.

When you finish all dough and topping, place them on lightly greased baking dish or cookie sheet. Bake in 400 F pre-heated oven until golden brown and crispy. Before you serve it slice them into medium squares and serve with AYRAN!
