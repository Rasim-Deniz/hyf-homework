Allow it to boil gently for about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the grain to cool and soak overnight.The next morning, the grain should have absorbed most, if not all the liquid. Gather the rest of the ingredients. Add the chickpeas, beans, rice, dried fruits, sugar, and optional rose water or orange and lemon zest. Add more water to just cover the ingredients if needed. Bring the mixture to a boil. Stir the mixture gently with a wooden spoon as it cooks until it thickens. Remove it from the heat and fill dessert bowls or a large serving bowl with the pudding. Once it cools down and sets, cover, and refrigerate it for several hours. Before serving, garnish the pudding with fresh pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, finely chopped dried fruits, and groundnuts. Some prefer their pudding more watery, some prefer it stiffer. If you prefer a stiffer pudding, add 1 or 2 teaspoons of powdered gelatin while the mixture cooks. This will give you a firmer pudding once it cools down.', 'Konya', NOW(), 6, 20, '2021-04-22');

In a separate bowl, beat the egg, plain yogurt, flour, and 1 cup of water briskly with a wire whisk until well blended and creamy. Make sure you have no lumps of flour or yogurt. Using your wire whisk, stir the rice-water mixture and add the yogurt-water mixture while gently whisking. Then, add salt and white pepper. Allow the mixture to heat through until steaming. Continue whisking gently without letting the soup come to a boil. If the soup becomes too thick for your liking, add a little more water. In a separate pan, melt the butter and add the dried mint. Stir thoroughly and remove from the heat quickly. Add the butter and mint to the soup and continue whisking until well combined. Garnish each bowl of soup with a sprig of fresh mint leaves. If you wish, you can also keep the butter and mint separate and drizzle it over the top of the soup just before serving. If you want to spice up your soup a little more, optionally add about 1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes to the butter along with the mint. Serve and enjoy!', 'Ordu', NOW(), 2, 10, '2021-04-21');

	values ('Yaprak Sarma', 'Rinse the rice well. Heat some olive oil in a pan. Add the rice and fry shortly. Add the tomato and pepper paste and stir everything together well. Fry for about a minute. Add parsley, paprika powder, mint, pepper, and salt. Use a bit more than you would usually do because in the boiling process, part of the flavor will evaporate. Stir well and take the pan off the heat. You are going to fill the vine leaves with uncooked rice. The rice will be cooked later with the vine leaves. Leave the mixture to cool down. In the meantime, take the vine leaves from the package and carefully take them apart. Rinse them one by one. Put all the leaves in a pan with boiled water (not on the stove) and leave them for five minutes. Drain. Take a large pan and put some olive oil on the bottom. Put a few broken vine leaves on the bottom of the pan. This will stop the yaprak sarma from sticking to the pan. Now you can start rolling the vine leaves. Use a cutting board to put the vine leaves on. On one side of the board, put the pan with the rice mixture and put a plate with vine leaves and on the other side to put the yaprak sarma in. Take a vine leave and put it on the cutting board with the veins up. Cut or break the stem off carefully. Put a little bit of the rice mixture onto the bottom of the leaf. Make sure you leave some space between the rice and the end of the leaf. Take the two lowest ends of the leaf and fold them over the rice. Do the same for the left and the right end of the leaf. Then roll up the leaf tightly from the bottom to the top. The first ones will be a bit difficult, but after a few you will know how to do it. Put the sarma into the pan and repeat the same steps for the other vine leaves. Make sure that you put the yaprak sarma close to each other in the pan. If they are too loose, the rolls can open while cooking. If the bottom of the pan has been filled, you can put the next sarma on top of the others. When you have finished all the sarmas, cut a lemon into slices. Put the slices on top of the sarmas and put a plate, turned upside-down on top of that. This will prevent the sarmas from opening while boiling . Mix boiling water with a tablespoon of tomato paste and a stock cube. Pour the water into the pan until the plate is just under water. Put the pan on the stove and bring to boil. Leave the sarmas to simmer for 45 minutes on low heat. It is important that you use a pan that is big enough because the sarmas will get bigger while boiling. The rice increases in volume when it is cooked. Turn off the heat after 45 minutes and leave the sarmas in the pan with a lid on (without draining the water) for at least 30 more minutes.', 'Izmir', NOW(), 4, 40, '2021-04-23');
